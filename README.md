## Why?
Cool streamers have screen-reader software that allows them to show the keys they are typing on screen. 
I wanted that but with a better visual appeal

## Building
The project uses X11, raylib and nob.h. Make sure X11 and raylib are installed

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hexaredecimal/TYPESUPERFASTJUTSU.git
$ cd TYPESUPERFASTJUTSU

# Bootsrap your build system
$ gcc nob.c -o nob

# Build the final executable
$ ./nob
```
